# ⚔️ Welcome to the Campaign Wiki

Your party's shared tome of knowledge. Everything you need to remember about the world, its people, and your adventures — all in one place.

## 🎲 Campaigns

- [[campaigns/Daring-Deeds-Division/index|Daring Deeds Division]] — Greyhawk, run by Danny
- [[campaigns/Friday-Knights/index|Friday Knights]] — Active campaign
- [[campaigns/Saturday-Sorcerers/index|Saturday Sorcerers]] — The Sword Coast, run by Archmage Dave

> [!tip] Adding a new campaign
> Create a new folder under `campaigns/` with subfolders for `characters/`, `locations/`, and `sessions/`, plus an `index.md` overview page. Check the `_templates/Campaign.md` template for the recommended structure.
