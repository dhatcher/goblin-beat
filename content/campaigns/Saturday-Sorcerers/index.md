# Saturday Sorcerers

> [!info] Campaign Details
> **DM:** Archmage Dave
> **Setting:** The Sword Coast, Faerûn
> **Status:** Active
> **Schedule:** Every Saturday, 6 PM

## World Overview

The Sword Coast stretches along the western edge of Faerûn, a land of crumbling ruins, ancient magic, and uneasy alliances. The Lords' Alliance holds the major cities together in a fragile peace, but dark forces stir in the Underdark below and the wilds between. Our party of unlikely heroes met in a tavern in Neverwinter (as one does) and has since been drawn into a web of intrigue involving a missing archmage and a cult seeking to unleash an elder evil.

## Major Factions

- **The Lords' Alliance** — A coalition of rulers from cities across the Sword Coast, working to maintain order and mutual defense.
- **The Zhentarim** — A shadowy network of merchants and mercenaries with fingers in every pie. Not strictly evil, but definitely not good.
- **The Cult of the Shattered Star** — A mysterious cult gathering fragments of a broken artifact. Their true purpose remains unknown.

## Active Quests

- [ ] **The Missing Archmage** — Archmage Sylara vanished from her tower in [[locations/Neverwinter|Neverwinter]] three tendays ago. Her apprentice begs the party to investigate.
- [ ] **Shadows in the Underdark** — Strange creatures have been emerging from cave systems near the coast. The local militia is overwhelmed.
